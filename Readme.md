the Forecast.io API and display the results on the same page below the form.

The user provides the location information such as Street address, City and State for which they
would want to find the detailed weather information or provide their current location.

Once the user has provided the data and clicks on the Search button, validation will be done to

The 3 tabs correspond to Current tab, Hourly tab and Weekly tab.
Your webpage also support adding cities to and removing cities from the Favorites tab and
